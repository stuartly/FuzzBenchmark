To do a new import:

1. go to ftp.openbsd.org and get sources from libexec/ftpd. The files
are:

    Makefile     ftpcmd.y    ftpd.c       logwtmp.c    popen.c
    extern.h     ftpd.8      logutmp.c    pathnames.h

If OpenBSD has added more files, be sure to get them and update this
list. Put the files in a temp directory.

2. Update this file as necessary (including particularly the date at
the top) and copy it into the temp directory under the name README.

3. Make sure CVSROOT is set correctly.

4. Do the following:

  cvs import -m "Import from OpenBSD <desc>" linux-ftpd/ftpd \
	openbsd openbsd-<version>

where <version> should represent the OpenBSD version, either a release
number or the date of a -current in the form 19990630, and <desc>
should hold the same information in a human-readable format.

Note that you can't use . in cvs tags; use _ instead.

E.g.:

  cvs import -m "Import from OpenBSD 1.4" linux-ftpd/ftpd openbsd openbsd-1_4

or

  cvs import -m "Import from OpenBSD June 30, 1999" linux-ftpd/ftpd \
	openbsd openbsd-19990630


5. If there are merge conflicts cvs will tell you to do a cvs checkout
with some -j flags. Do that in a scratch tree, clean up the conflicts,
and commit the results. Then update your main working tree, build, and
test.

You may want to manually check any OpenBSD changes to see if they have
added anything that won't work in Linux.
