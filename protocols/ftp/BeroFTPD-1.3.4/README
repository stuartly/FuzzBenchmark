BeroFTPD FTP SERVER, RELEASE 1.3.3 -- 07 February 1999

Before reporting a bug, please make sure it is still present in the most
current version.
It can be found at
ftp://beroftpd.unix.eu.org/pub/BeroFTPD/
ftp://ftp.croftj.net/usr/bero/BeroFTPD/
ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/nir/ftp/servers/BeroFTPD/
ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/mirror/BeroFTPD/

Mostly minor fixes that (IMO) don't justify a new release can be found in

BeroFTPD is a replacement ftp server for Un*x systems based on wu-ftpd.
Besides supporting the ftp protocol defined in RFC 959, it adds the following
major features (and a couple of minor ones not mentioned here):
    o  logging of transfers
    o  logging of commands
    o  on the fly compression and archiving
    o  classification of users on type and location
    o  per class limits
    o  per directory upload permissions
    o  restricted guest accounts
    o  system wide and per directory messages
    o  directory alias
    o  cdpath
    o  filename filter
    o  better virtual host support (similar to the apache httpd server)
    o  optional E-mail notification when anonymous users upload files
    o  possibility to run as standalone daemon (without inetd)
    o  support for HOST command (currently in draft)
    o  possibility to use different passwd/shadow files for virtual hosts

BeroFTPD is based on wu-ftpd-2.4.2-academ-b18. In very many ways, BeroFTPD
is still wu-ftpd.
The primary difference between BeroFTPD and wu-ftpd is that the wu-ftpd
developers think ALL bugs need to be fixed before new features are added -
BeroFTPD aims at fixing bugs as quickly as possible (rather than collecting
all sorts of bugfixes and making a release every couple of months), and
starting to add new features right away. For a list of new features already
implemented, look at the CHANGES file. For some future plans, look at the
FUTURE-CHANGES file.

BeroFTPD is presently maintained by Bernhard Rosenkraenzer
(bero@linux.net.eu.org).
Please send bug reports to beroftpd-bugs@linux.net.eu.org.
The current version can be found at ftp://linux.net.eu.org/pub/BeroFTPD;
updates will appear on all sunsite mirrors shortly after they're released.

We have introduced a new version numbering scheme based on the one used in
Linux kernels - versions with an even minor number (1.0.x, 1.2.x, ...) are
considered stable. There will not be any major features added in them, only
bugs fixed.
Versions with odd minor numbers (1.1.x, 1.3.x, ...) are experimental
versions, primarily there to test new features and major changes. If you
need a reliable ftp server, don't use them unless you absolutely need one of
their features.

Every new release is tested on a K6 running BeroLinux 1.0
(http://www.berolinux.za.net/ = Linux 2.2 with glibc 2.0.7) as
well as a pentium running FreeBSD 4.0-CURRENT (the CVS version).
If you want me to test on other platforms as well, send me the OS you're
interested in and the hardware required to run it. ;)

It is strongly recommended that you READ ALL THESE FILES before you start
attempting to to install this software:

	o INSTALL covers basic installation.
	o NOTES covers some specific issues with respect to documentation,
	  some system specific information, and some general tips for
	  setting up wu-ftpd.
	o VIRTUAL.FTP.SUPPORT outlines how to configure virtual FTP
	  servers.

Since BeroFTPD is based on wu-ftpd, you can try the following sources for
setting up the server:
    o  _Managing Internet Information Services_, An O'Reilly and Associates
       book.  This book has many excellent chapters on setting up 
       anonymous ftp sites using standard ftp servers as well as the
       wu-ftpd server.
