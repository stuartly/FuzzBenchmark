The following bugs are known at release time:

----- general bugs -----
* ftpck generally reports some failures that are none - not all of
  BeroFTPD's new features are known to it yet.

----- bugs in internal ls -----

* ls always displays only one file per line [not much of a problem; most
  command line clients use ls -l anyway, graphical clients reformat the
  output in whatever way they want.]
