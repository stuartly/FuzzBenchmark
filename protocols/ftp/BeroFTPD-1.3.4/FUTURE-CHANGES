The following will be implemented in a future version:

- Replace --enable-chmod-limit with a runtime option
- Make upload-notification a per-directory option
- Support new ftp commands, such as FEAT and MLST
- get rid of ALL remaining #ifdef SOME_OS constructs
- make the set(e)uid / set(e)gid calls optional if we're running as
  standalone daemon on an unprivileged port, and permitting anonymous
  access only. That way, BeroFTPD can be run by ordinary users.
- Make ratio stuff more consistant (typelist as argument rather than
  *|anonymous|guest), permit ratios for real users.
