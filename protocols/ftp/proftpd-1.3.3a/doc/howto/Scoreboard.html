<p>
<b>What is the Scoreboard</b><br>
The <code>ScoreboardFile</code> is used by <code>proftpd</code> for tracking
information for each current FTP session.  It is necessary for things like
<code>MaxClients</code>, <code>MaxClientsPerUser</code>, <i>etc</i>.
The utility programs (<code>ftpwho</code>, <code>ftpcount</code>,
<code>ftptop</code>) read the scoreboard and display its information.

<p>
Here's how <code>proftpd</code> handles its scoreboard: There is a default
path that <code>proftpd</code> will use for writing its scoreboard
(<code>var/proftpd/proftpd.scoreboard</code>).  This default path depends on
how you install proftpd (<i>i.e.</i> if you install from source and use the
--prefix <code>configure</code> option, the default path will be adjusted to
honor your --prefix).  However, you can also explicitly tell the daemon what
location to use for its scoreboard using the <code>ScoreboardFile</code>
configuration directive in your <code>proftpd.conf</code>.  When
the daemon starts up, it looks to see if there is a scoreboard already there;
if there isn't, it makes a new one.

<p>
The most common error encountered when opening the scoreboard is:
<pre>
  unable to open scoreboard: No such file or directory
</pre>
This usually means that <code>proftpd</code> is trying to open a
<code>ScoreboardFile</code> in a directory that does not exist.  Some packages
fail to create the needed directory; this will result in the error message
above.  If you cannot find your <code>ScoreboardFile</code>, you should try
explicitly configuring the path to the file to use in your
<code>proftpd.conf</code>, using the <code>ScoreboardFile</code> configuration
directive, and then obtaining debugging output from your <code>proftpd</code>,
to see if the daemon ran into problems using that defined location.

<p>
<b>Scrubbing the Scoreboard</b><br>
There is a bad habit among system administrators of using
<code>`kill -9'</code> to kill a misbehaving process.  Any process that is
terminated this way, though, does not have a chance of properly shutting down.
Administrators would use <code>`kill -9'</code> on some of
<code>proftpd</code>'s session processes, which means that they would not be
able to remove their entries from the <code>ScoreboardFile</code>.
Utilities like <code>ftpwho</code> and <code>ftptop</code> would show sessions
that no longer existed.

<p>
The chance of changing this bad habit in system administrators is slim, so
<code>proftpd</code> was changed to check the <code>ScoreboardFile</code>
periodically.  It will scan the entire file, and for each scoreboard session
listed, it asks the operating system if that session process is still alive.
If the answer is no, the entry is removed from the file.  This process is
known as &quot;scrubbing&quot;.

<p>
By default, this scrubbing process occurs every 30 seconds.  For busy/heavily
loaded sites, this scrubbing interval might be too short; heavily loaded
servers are more likely to encounter lock contention issues between sessions
trying to update their scoreboard entry and the daemon trying to scrub
the scoreboard.  Such sites are advised to use <code>ScoreboardScrub</code>
configuration directive.  This directive can be used to turn on or off
the periodic scrubbing, or to set a different scrub interval.  The following
shows some examples of <code>ScoreboardScrub</code> usage:
<pre>
  # The default is to use scoreboard scrubbing, at the default interval
  ScoreboardScrub on

  # If we are busy server, we might want to turn off scoreboard scrubbing
  # entirely
  ScoreboardScrub off

  # Scrubbing is acceptable, but have it happen every 5 minutes instead
  ScoreboardScrub 300
</pre>

<p>
Note that if scoreboard scrubbing is turned off, the
<code>ScoreboardFile</code> can still be scrubbed on demand, either by using
the <a href="../contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html#scoreboard"><code>mod_ctrls_admin</code></a>'s "ftpdctl scoreboard scrub" action, or by using the
<code>ftpscrub</code> command-line utility.

<p>
<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why doesn't <code>proftpd</code> create the needed directories, if they're not there, when opening the scoreboard?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The short answer is because that is the
job of the system administrator, not the application.  The long reason
is that <code>proftpd</code> does not know the filesystem layout being
used, and does not know what sort of permissions should be given to any
directories it might need to create for its scoreboard.

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Can I copy my scoreboard from one server to another?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: No. <code>ScoreboardFile</code>s cannot be
copied from server to server; they are specific to that particular
installation.

<p>
In the same fashion, you should not try to place the scoreboard on an NFS
filesystem.  First, attempting to share the scoreboard is not supported, and
will only lead to trouble.  Second, NFS does not support file locking, which
<code>proftpd</code> requires for handling the scoreboard.

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why do I see &quot;scrubbing scoreboard&quot; in my debugging output?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: These debug messages indicate when the
<code>proftpd</code> daemon is scrubbing the <code>ScoreboardFile</code>.

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Our site has <i>many</i> connections, and
it looks like the logins/sessions are slow.  Analysis shows that the
session processes are all waiting/competing for the
<code>ScoreboardFile</code>.  What can be done to fix this?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: One particular trick to use for this situation
is to use <code>/dev/null</code>, <i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
  ScoreboardFile /dev/null
</pre>
For one site which tried this configuration, <code>proftpd</code> was able
to function without complaining about using <code>/dev/null</code> as the
<code>ScoreboardFile</code>, the system load dropped dramatically, and
the FTP sessions were no longer slow.

<p>
<b>However</b>, be aware that using this trick causes the following to
<b>NOT</b> work:
<ul>
  <li>ftpwho
  <li>ftptop
  <li><code>MaxClients</code>
  <li><code>MaxClientsPerClass</code>
  <li><code>MaxClientsPerHost</code>
  <li><code>MaxClientsPerUser</code>
  <li><code>MaxConnectionsPerHost</code>
  <li><code>MaxHostsPerUser</code>
  <li><code>MaxTransfersPerHost</code>
  <li><code>MaxTransfersPerUser</code>
</ul>

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: What should I do if I see this error in my
logs:
<pre>
  error opening scoreboard: bad version (too old)
</pre>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: This error usually only happens for servers
which have:
<pre>
  ServerType inetd
</pre>
in their <code>proftpd.conf</code> files.  It indicates that the existing
<code>ScoreboardFile</code> is using a format which is too old for the running
code.  The fix is simple: delete that old <code>ScoreboardFile</code>.  The
daemon will automatically create a new scoreboard in the correct format.
