@table @code
@item GNUTLS_@-SERVER
Connection end is a server.
@item GNUTLS_@-CLIENT
Connection end is a client.
@item GNUTLS_@-DATAGRAM
Connection is datagram oriented (DTLS). Since 3.0.0.
@item GNUTLS_@-NONBLOCK
Connection should not block. Since 3.0.0.
@item GNUTLS_@-NO_@-EXTENSIONS
Do not enable any TLS extensions by default (since 3.1.2).
@item GNUTLS_@-NO_@-REPLAY_@-PROTECTION
Disable any replay protection in DTLS. This must only be used if  replay protection is achieved using other means. Since 3.2.2.
@item GNUTLS_@-NO_@-SIGNAL
In systems where SIGPIPE is delivered on send, it will be disabled. That flag has effect in systems which support the MSG_NOSIGNAL sockets flag (since 3.4.2).
@item GNUTLS_@-ALLOW_@-ID_@-CHANGE
Allow the peer to replace its certificate, or change its ID during a rehandshake. This change is often used in attacks and thus prohibited by default. Since 3.5.0.
@item GNUTLS_@-ENABLE_@-FALSE_@-START
Enable the TLS false start on client side if the negotiated ciphersuites allow it. This will enable sending data prior to the handshake being complete, and may introduce a risk of crypto failure when combined with certain key exchanged; for that GnuTLS may not enable that option in ciphersuites that are known to be not safe for false start. Since 3.5.0.
@item GNUTLS_@-FORCE_@-CLIENT_@-CERT
When in client side and only a single cert is specified, send that certificate irrespective of the issuers expected by the server. Since 3.5.0.
@item GNUTLS_@-NO_@-TICKETS
Flag to indicate that the session should not use resumption with session tickets.
