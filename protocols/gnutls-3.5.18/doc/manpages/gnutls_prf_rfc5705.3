.SH NAME
gnutls_prf_rfc5705 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_prf_rfc5705(gnutls_session_t " session ", size_t " label_size ", const char * " label ", size_t " context_size ", const char * " context ", size_t " outsize ", char * " out ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "size_t label_size" 12
length of the  \fIlabel\fP variable.
.IP "const char * label" 12
label used in PRF computation, typically a short string.
.IP "size_t context_size" 12
length of the  \fIextra\fP variable.
.IP "const char * context" 12
optional extra data to seed the PRF with.
.IP "size_t outsize" 12
size of pre\-allocated output buffer to hold the output.
.IP "char * out" 12
pre\-allocated buffer to hold the generated data.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Applies the TLS Pseudo\-Random\-Function (PRF) on the master secret
and the provided data, seeded with the client and server random fields,
as specified in RFC5705.

The  \fIlabel\fP variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose
for the generated data.  The  \fIserver_random_first\fP indicates whether
the client random field or the server random field should be first
in the seed.  Non\-zero indicates that the server random field is first,
0 that the client random field is first.

The  \fIcontext\fP variable can be used to add more data to the seed, after
the random variables.  It can be used to make sure the
generated output is strongly connected to some additional data
(e.g., a string used in user authentication). 

The output is placed in  \fIout\fP , which must be pre\-allocated.

Note that, to provide the RFC5705 context, the  \fIcontext\fP variable
must be non\-null.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.4
