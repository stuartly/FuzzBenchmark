.SH NAME
gnutls_record_get_direction \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_record_get_direction(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function provides information about the internals of the
record protocol and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call,
e.g.  \fBgnutls_handshake()\fP, was interrupted for some reason. That
is, if a function returned \fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP or
\fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP. In such a case, you might want to call \fBselect()\fP
or \fBpoll()\fP before restoring the interrupted gnutls function.

This function's output is unreliable if you are using the same
 \fIsession\fP in different threads, for sending and receiving.
.SH "RETURNS"
0 if interrupted while trying to read data, or 1 while trying to write data.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
