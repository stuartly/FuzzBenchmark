@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_session_get_data} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, void * @var{session_data}, size_t * @var{session_data_size})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{session_data}: is a pointer to space to hold the session.

@var{session_data_size}: is the session_data's size, or it will be set by the function.

Returns all session parameters needed to be stored to support resumption.
The client should call this, and store the returned session data. A session
may be resumed later by calling @code{gnutls_session_set_data()} .  

This function will fail if called prior to handshake completion. In
case of false start TLS, the handshake completes only after data have
been successfully received from the peer.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
