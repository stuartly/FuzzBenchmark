This is a list of the DB collections types that the SM uses, and their fields.

type: active
user: core
fields: time            os_type_INTEGER

If a user has a stored value for "active" then they "exist" for the purposes
of routing and delivery. The value is the time (in seconds since the epoch)
that they were first "created". This value is stored in user->active, which
is used by mod_offline and mod_roster to determine if it should bother
processing messages and subscription requests.


type: logout
user: mod_iq_last
fields: time            os_type_INTEGER

This stores the time (in seconds since the epoch) of the last session that
logged out. This is used to provide an iq:last response when there are no
sessions online.


type: roster-items
user: mod_roster
fields: jid             os_type_STRING
        name            os_type_STRING
        to              os_type_BOOLEAN
        from            os_type_BOOLEAN
        ask             os_type_BOOLEAN

This stores the roster items that make a user's roster.
        

type: roster-groups
user: mod_roster
fields: jid             os_type_STRING
        group           os_type_STRING

This stores the groups associated with each of a user's roster items.


type: vcard
user: mod_iq_vcard
fields:
        fn              os_type_STRING
        nickname        os_type_STRING
        url             os_type_STRING
        tel             os_type_STRING
        email           os_type_STRING
        title           os_type_STRING
        role            os_type_STRING
        bday            os_type_STRING
        desc            os_type_STRING
        n-given         os_type_STRING
        n-family        os_type_STRING
        adr-street      os_type_STRING
        adr-extadd      os_type_STRING
        adr-locality    os_type_STRING
        adr-region      os_type_STRING
        adr-pcode       os_type_STRING
        adr-country     os_type_STRING
        org-orgname     os_type_STRING
        org-orgunit     os_type_STRING

Stores the various fields the make up the user's vcard.


type: queue
user: mod_offline
fields: xml             os_type_NAD

This stores messages and s10n requests that are waiting to be delivered
to the user. Each DB row contains a single complete packet.


type: private
user: mod_iq_private
fields: ns              os_type_STRING
        xml             os_type_NAD

This stores user private data (iq:private). ns holds the namespace (for
fast lookup), and xml holds the complete packet (actually a copy of the
original IQ set that stored the packet).


type: motd-messages
user: mod_announce
fields: xml             os_type_NAD

This stores the current "message of the day" message. There is only one
motd at any one time.


type: motd-times
user: mod_announce
fields: time            os_type_INTEGER

This stores the time of the last motd message that a user received. It
is used to determine whether to send the current motd to the user.
