  <p>The Account token you provided either expired, is invalid or verification failed.
  <br />
  <br />Please keep in mind that the tokens have a max validity of five minutes after 
  <br />which they will expire and you will have to repeat the registration process.
  <br />
  <br />It's also possible that additional checks were performed on your mail address
  <br />and your registration request was therefore invalidated.</p>
