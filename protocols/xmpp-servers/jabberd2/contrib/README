This directory contains patches to the code which you may or may 
not find useful. They are modifications to the main source which
would have had a detrimental affect towards jabberd2's goal of
100% xmpp compliance. Or they simply were not deemed appropriate
to add into the main source dist. However, there are situations
in which this code may be of use, so the patches are kept here.

These patches are not maintained by jabberd2 team and may or may 
not be out of date. You are have been warned. 

Good Luck
