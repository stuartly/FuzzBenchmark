Companies usually have their networks divided into 2 parts: <span class="strong"><strong>DMZ</strong></span> which is partially open to the outside world and the <span class="strong"><strong>Private network</strong></span> which is closed to the outside world.</p><p>If the XMPP server is to provide an effective way of communication between company employees regardless if they are in a secure company office or outside (perhaps at a customer site), it needs to accept both internal and external connections. So the natural location for the server deployment is the <span class="strong"><strong>DMZ</strong></span>. However, this solution has some considerations: each company has normally established network users base and integrated authorization mechanisms. However, that information should be stored outside the DMZ to protect internal security, so how to maintain ease of installation and system security?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Tigase server</strong></span> offers a solution for such a case. With it&#8217;s component structure, Tigase can be easily deployed on any number machines and from the user&#8217;s point of view it is seen as a one logical XMPP server. In this case we can install a Session Manager module in the <span class="strong"><strong>private</strong></span> network, and a Client Connection Manager with Server Connection Manager in the <span class="strong"><strong>DMZ</strong></span>.</p><p>Session Manager connects to <span class="strong"><strong>DMZ</strong></span> and receives all packets from external users. Thus is can securely realize users authorization based on company authorization mechanisms.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="about.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="about.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="_flexibility.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;About Tigase XMPP Server&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Flexibility</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
