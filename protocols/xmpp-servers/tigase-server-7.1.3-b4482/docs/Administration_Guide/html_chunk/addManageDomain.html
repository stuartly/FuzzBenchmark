You do not have to ask an administrator to add your domain or add users for your domain anymore. You can do it on your own.</p><p>Please note, this is very new stuff. Something may go wrong or may not be polished. Please report any problems, notices or suggestions.</p><p>This is the guide to walk you through the new functions and describes how to add a new domain and new users within your domain.</p><p>You can do everything from your XMPP client or you can use our web application that allows you to connect to the service and execute admin commands. I recommend <a class="link" href="http://psi-im.org/" target="_top">Psi</a> because of its excellent support for parts of the XMPP protocol which are used for domains and user management. You may use other clients as well, but we can only offer support and help if you use Psi client.</p><p>Secondly, you need an account on the server. This is because all the commands and features described here are available to local users only. Therefore, if you do not have a registered domain with us yet, please go ahead and register an account on the website either the <a class="link" href="http://jabber.me/" target="_top">Jabber.Me</a> or <a class="link" href="http://www.tigase.im/" target="_top">Tigase.IM</a>.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_adding_a_new_domain"></a>Adding a New Domain</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you register an account on one of the websites, connect to the XMPP server using the account on the Psi client. We will be using the following account: <a class="link" href="mailto:green@tigase.im" target="_top">green@tigase.im</a> which is this guide.</p><p>When you are ready right click on the account name in Psi roster window to bring up context menu. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Service Discovery</strong></span> element.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/service_disco_menu.png" alt="service_disco_menu"></span></p><p>A new windows pops up as in the example on the right. The service discovery window is where all the stuff installed on XMPP service should show up. Most of elements on the list are well known transports, MUC and PubSub components. The new stuff on the list, which we are interested in, are 2 elements: <span class="strong"><strong>VHost Manager</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Session Manager</strong></span>.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/service_disco_window_vhost.png" alt="service_disco_window_vhost"></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>VHost Manager</strong></span> component in Tigase is responsible for managing and controlling virtual hosts on the installation. It provides virtual hosts information to all other parts of the system and also allows you to add new hosts and remove/update existing virtual hosts.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Session Manager</strong></span> component in Tigase is responsible for managing users. In most cases online users but it can also perform some actions on user repository where all user data is stored.</p><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>VHost Manager</strong></span> and double click on it. A new windows shows up (might be hidden behind the service discovery window). The window contains another menu with a few items: <span class="strong"><strong>Add&#8230;&#8203;, Remove&#8230;&#8203;</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Update&#8230;&#8203;</strong></span> . These are for adding, removing and updating VHost information. For now, just select the first element <span class="strong"><strong>Add&#8230;&#8203;.</strong></span></p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/command_menu_add_vhost.png" alt="command_menu_add_vhost"></span></p><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Execute</strong></span> and you get a new window where you can enter all of your VHost configuration details. All fields should be self explanatory. Leave a blank field for <span class="strong"><strong>Other parameters</strong></span> for now. <span class="strong"><strong>Owner</strong></span> is you, that is Jabber ID which controls the domain and can change the domain configuration settings or can remove the domain from the service. <span class="strong"><strong>Administrators</strong></span> field can be left blank or can contain comma separated list of Jabber IDs for people who can manage users within the domain. You do not need to add your user name to the list as Owners can always manage users for the domain.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/add_vhost_window.png" alt="add_vhost_window"></span></p><p>When you are ready click the <span class="strong"><strong>Finish</strong></span> button. All done, hopefully. You can get either a window confirming everything went well or a window printing an error message if something went wrong. What can be wrong? There are some restrictions I decided to put on the service to prevent abuse. One of the restrictions is the maximum number of domains a user can register for himself which is <span class="strong"><strong>25</strong></span> right now. Another restriction is that the domain which you add must have a valid DNS entry pointing to our service. The XMPP guide describes all the details about DNS settings. Please refer to these instructions if you need more details.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_adding_a_new_user"></a>Adding a New User</h3></div></div></div><p>Adding a new user process is quite similar, almost identical to adding a new domain. This time, however we have to select <span class="strong"><strong>Session Manager</strong></span> in the service discovery window.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/service_disco_window_sm.png" alt="service_disco_window_sm"></span></p><p>Double click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Session Manager</strong></span> and a window with SM&#8217;s commands list shows up. Right now, there is only one command available to domain administrators - <span class="strong"><strong>Add user</strong></span>. I am going to make available more commands in the future and I am waiting for your suggestions.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/command_menu_add_user.png" alt="command_menu_add_user"></span></p><p>If you click <span class="strong"><strong>Execute</strong></span> a window presented on the left shows up. Fill all fields accordingly and press <span class="strong"><strong>Finish</strong></span>.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/add_user_window.png" alt="add_user_window"></span></p><p>If everything went well you have just added a new user and you should get a window confirming successful operation. If something went wrong, a window with an error message should show up. Possible errors may be you tried to add a user which is already present, or you may have tried to add a user for a domain to which you do not have permission or to non-existen domain.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_ssl_certificate_management"></a>SSL Certificate Management</h3></div></div></div><p>SSL Certificate Management has been implemented, and certificates can be manipulated when in a .pem form.
