.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
prosodyctl is the control tool for the Prosody XMPP server.
It may be used to control the server daemon and manage users.
.PP
prosodyctl needs to be executed with sufficient privileges to perform
its commands.
This typically means executing prosodyctl as the root user.
If a user named "prosody" is found then prosodyctl will change to that
user before executing its commands.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS User Management
.PP
In the following commands users are identified by a Jabber ID, jid, of
the usual form: user\@domain.

You will be prompted to enter the user\[aq]s password.

.SS Daemon Management
.PP
Although prosodyctl has commands to manage the prosody daemon it is
recommended that you utilize your distributions daemon management
features if you attained Prosody through a package.
.PP
To perform daemon control commands prosodyctl needs a pidfile value
specified in \f[C]/etc/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua\f[].
Failure to do so will cause prosodyctl to complain.
.TP
.B start
Starts the prosody server daemon.
If run as root prosodyctl will attempt to change to a user named
"prosody" before executing.
This operation will block for up to five seconds to wait for the server
to execute.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B stop

This operation will block for up to five seconds to wait for the server
to stop executing.
